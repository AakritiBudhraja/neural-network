# neural-network

This is a simple implementation of a Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network. This network will be trained and
tested using the A-Z Handwritten Alphabets dataset. Specifically, given an input image
(28 x 28 = 784 pixels) from the dataset, the network will be trained to classify the image
into 1 of 10 classes.(Randomly sampled).
